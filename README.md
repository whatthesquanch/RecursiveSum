# RecursiveSum
Option #2:  Implementing Recursion to Provide a Sum
Using recursion, create a program that will allow a user to enter five numbers. The program will provide the sum of all five numbers using recursive methods.

Submit screenshots of your program's execution and output. Include all appropriate source code in a zip file.

Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.
